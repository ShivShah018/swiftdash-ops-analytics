|-------|------|-------------|
| `customers` | 12,000 | age, gender, city, signup_date, is_active |
| `restaurants` | 250 | cuisine_type, rating, preparation_time_mins |

## Database Schema (MySQL)

Six tables with foreign keys, indexes, `ON DELETE` rules, and audit timestamps:

```
customers  1───* orders *───1 restaurants
                   │
                   *
             order_items
                   │
                   1
                   │
            delivery_logs  *───1 drivers
```

- **`ON DELETE RESTRICT`** on customer/restaurant FKs (prevents orphan orders)
- **`ON DELETE SET NULL`** on driver FK (cancelled orders have no driver)
- **`ON DELETE CASCADE`** on order_items / delivery_logs (clean deletion)
- Indexes on `order_date`, `customer_id`, `restaurant_id`, `order_status`, `payment_method`
- `created_at` / `updated_at` timestamps on every table

---

## SQL Analysis — 50 Queries

### Revenue (10 queries)
Monthly revenue with MoM growth (`LAG`), revenue by payment method / city / hour / cuisine, revenue lost to cancellations, discount impact analysis, weekday vs weekend comparison.

### Customer (10 queries)
RFM segmentation (Platinum/Gold/Silver/At Risk/Churned with documented thresholds), customer lifetime value ranking, repeat customer rate, cohort retention analysis, age/gender analysis, acquisition trends, preferred payment methods.

### Operations (10 queries)
Delivery time by hour / traffic / weather, driver efficiency ranking, vehicle type comparison, peak hour analysis, outlier detection (deliveries > 60 min), refund rate (CTE-based).

### Restaurant (10 queries)
Top restaurants by revenue, cuisine performance, most popular items, cross-selling analysis (self-join market basket), cancellation rate by restaurant, revenue concentration (Pareto via `NTILE`), cuisine popularity by city.

### KPI Dashboard (10 queries)
Executive scorecard, MoM KPI comparison, top 10% customer contribution (`NTILE`), daily active users, payment adoption trends, cohort retention, customer LTV trend, platform economics breakdown, surge pricing analysis, business health scorecard.

## Power BI Dashboard

The dashboard is available as a **PbixProj folder** ([open-source format](https://pbi.tools/)) that can be compiled into a `.pbit` template and then opened in Power BI Desktop.

### Quick start (PbixProj → .pbit → .pbix)

**Option A — pbi-tools** (requires Power BI Desktop v2.155.x installed):

```bash
python scripts/build_powerbi.py                           # generate PbixProj
pbi-tools compile dashboard/swiftdash_dashboard.pbip \
            dashboard/swiftdash_dashboard.pbit PBIT True  # compile .pbit
```

**Option B — Power BI Desktop**:

1. Open `dashboard/swiftdash_dashboard.pbit` (or the `.pbit` generated above)
2. Data → Transform Data → Source → point CSV paths to your `data/cleaned/` and `data/processed/`
3. Close & Apply → model loads and relationships are ready
4. All 5 report pages are pre‑laid out; use the Fields pane to bind visuals
5. File → Save As → `.pbix`

> **Note:** The PbixProj uses `"modelSerialization": "Raw"` (TMSL JSON). The model is stored as a single `Model/database.json` file. This avoids TMDL parser incompatibilities between pbi-tools and Power BI Desktop v2.155.

### What's included

| Artifact | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `dashboard/swiftdash_dashboard.pbip/` | PbixProj with TMSL model (10 tables), M queries, report layout |
| `dashboard/swiftdash_measures.dax` | All 25+ DAX measures as reference text |
| `dashboard/swiftdash_dashboard.pbit` | Compiled Power BI Template (open → refresh → save as .pbix) |

### Data model

TMSL definition at `dashboard/swiftdash_dashboard.pbip/Model/database.json`:

- **9 fact/dimension tables**: customers, restaurants, drivers, orders, order_items, delivery_logs, customer_features, restaurant_features, daily_metrics
- **Calendar table**: date, year, quarter, month, weekday, is_weekend
- **Relationships**: 9 defined — orders ↔ customers/restaurants/drivers, order_items ↔ orders, delivery_logs ↔ orders/drivers, feature tables ↔ dimensions
- **25+ DAX measures** including: Total Revenue, Cancellation Rate, On‑Time Delivery Rate, Repeat Customer Rate, Revenue MoM/YoY Growth, Revenue MTD/QTD/YTD, Surge Revenue Premium, Peak Hour Orders

### 5 Dashboard Pages

1. **Executive Summary** — KPI cards, monthly revenue trend, top cities
2. **Customer Analytics** — segment pie, revenue by segment, CLV, repeat rate, time patterns
3. **Restaurant Analytics** — cuisine revenue, revenue tiers, top restaurants, cancellation rates
4. **Delivery Operations** — travel time distribution, on‑time rate by traffic/weather, vehicle mix
5. **Business Insights** — MoM growth %, payment mix, weekday/weekend comparison, payment AOV

## Key Insights

**Revenue:** Monthly revenue shows consistent growth with seasonal Q4 peaks. UPI dominates at ~45% of transactions. Discounts under INR 50 show the best ROI; deep discounts (>INR 150) show diminishing returns.

**Customers:** Top 10% of customers contribute ~35-40% of revenue. Platinum + Gold segments (15% of customers) drive 40%+ of revenue. First-month retention drops to ~35-40% — a key improvement area. Age 25-34 is the highest-value segment.

**Operations:** Average delivery time: 25-35 minutes. Motorcycles outperform cars in high traffic (88% vs 72% on-time). Gridlock reduces on-time rates below 60%. Heavy rain increases delivery time by 30%+ and doubles cancellations.

**Restaurants:** North Indian, South Indian, and Chinese cuisines drive 60%+ of total revenue. Restaurants with prep time >30 min have 2x higher cancellation rates. Top 20% of restaurants contribute ~65% of revenue (Pareto).
